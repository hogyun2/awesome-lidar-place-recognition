This repository is the collection of LiDAR Place Recognition Research that provides a code or a download page, together. This repository also reports the datasets for Place Recognition and various algorithms utilized in Place Recognition (e.g. multi-robot mapping, SLAM).

LiDAR Place Recognition can be broadly categorized into **handcrafted**-based and **learning**-based methods. 

Datasets for LiDAR Place Recognition are classified into **single-session**, **multi-session**, and **multi-robot session**. Additionally, it is possible to confirm which **LiDAR** was used and which **vehicle** was utilized (üöô ü§ñ üõ©Ô∏è üö¢).

Finally, **various algorithms** that play an important role in Place Recognition are introduced.

üî• represents a paper citation count of 50 or more, or a code's star count of 50 or more.
